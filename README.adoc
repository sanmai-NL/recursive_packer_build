link:recursive_packer_build.sh[`recursive_packer_build.sh`] is a tiny shell script function library that helps building Packer-virtualized software, also for projects with Git-based dependency management based on link:Project_dependencies_as_Git_submodules.adoc[submodules].

== Requirements

* A POSIX-compatible shell and GNU/Linux. I'm open to patches and testing to ensure support of other operating systems.
* https://git-scm.com/[Git]
* https://packer.io[Packer].
* The `tac` command-line utility, offered by http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html[GNU coreutils]. This is normally already part of your OS distribution.

== To use

* ‘Source’ the library into your current shell session:
+
[source,Sh]
----
. 'recursive_packer_build.sh' # <1>
----
<1> Replace the path to 'recursive_packer_build.sh' to the absolute filesystem path if this doesn't work for you.
+
* Within the current shell session you can now issue the command:
+
[source,Sh]
----
build_all
----

You may put the source command in your shell profile to have it automatically available in each future shell session.
